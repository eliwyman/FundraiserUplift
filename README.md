# FundraiserUplift
Uplift model to predict donors to call to maximize donations.

This projects aim was to assist a charitable foundation using uplift modeling techniques (logistic and linear regression models). 
	
After having done a pilot study in 2020 where 100,000 donors were called at random, the results showed that depending on a personâ€™s personality
traits, calling them could either encourage or discourage them from donating. This project aims to use
prediction-based classification and regression algorithms to identify these two disparate groups of individuals
and prepare a proposal of individuals that should be called. This paper is broken down into the following
sections. First, an exploration of the donator data, including processing steps taken to prepare the data for input
into machine learning models. A discussion of the methods and algorithms used to identify the user groups as
well as to predict the donation amounts per individual will follow. The findings of the implementation of the
above approach will be outlined in the results section.
